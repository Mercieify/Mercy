## ðŸ§ª Technical Highlight: Data Analyst CV & GitHub Portfolio

As part of my transition into data analytics, a professional portfolio was created and hosted on GitHub. The process involved converting my traditional CV into a Markdown file to demonstrate not only my technical adaptability but also my storytelling ability. The CV highlights core and transferable skills in data analytics as well as experiences and career goals.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Markdown formatting for structured, professional documentation  
- GitHub version control and personal branding 
- Content curation and strategic editing to reflect my pivot into data analytics


## ðŸªž Process Reflection

This project was an intentional step toward owning my identity as a data analyst. While I don't have public projects (yet), this portfolio represents a fusion of my education background and analytical direction. I treated my CV like a data product â€” cleaning, refining, and formatting it with clarity and purpose.
Going forward, Iâ€™ll keep using GitHub not just for code, but as a record of growth, learning, and contribution.
